Cost optimization solution for Azure Cosmos DB using Blob Storage archiving

**Key Components:**
Component	Purpose
Azure Cosmos DB	Active data (<= 3 months)
Azure Blob Storage (Hot/Cold)	Archive for records > 3 months
Azure Functions	Handles data archival + retrieval
Azure Durable Timer	Triggers scheduled archival
Optional: Azure CDN/Front Door	Improve Blob access latency

**⚙️ Core Strategy**
1. Archive Old Records
Move Cosmos DB records older than 3 months to Azure Blob Storage as compressed JSON/Parquet files.

2. Intercept Legacy Read API
Use Cosmos DB’s “NotFound + fallback” inside your existing function to check Blob when old records are requested.

3. Zero Downtime
Reads/Writes continue uninterrupted in Cosmos DB. Migration happens via background jobs with retry and state tracking.

💰 **Cost Optimization Wins**
Technique	Impact
Archive cold data	Cosmos DB cost drops drastically (storage + RU/s)
Blob Cold/Archive Tier	Massive savings on rarely accessed data
Compression (e.g., GZIP, Parquet)	Lower blob size = cheaper storage
Read Throttling & Caching	Reduce function executions on frequent blob reads

🏆 **Production-Readiness Best Practices**
🔁 Durable Functions	For scalable batch archival with checkpointing
📉 Metrics & Logs	Azure Monitor + Application Insights
🔐 RBAC & Key Vault	Store connection strings securely
🧪 CI/CD	GitHub Actions for deploy pipelines
📊 Cost Analysis	Use Azure Cost Management to track savings
